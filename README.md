# Restaurant-System
For this project, we decided to create a system for a local restaurant. Our program, database, and
GUI will focus on keeping track of customer orders and their prices. This will help the restaurant
manage order details, including the customer's name, the food or drink items ordered, and the
total cost. Once an order is completed, employees will be able to remove it from the system,
making the process more organized and efficient
